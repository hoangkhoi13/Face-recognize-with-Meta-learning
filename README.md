* To equitment and run the code you could view the original project at
 " https://github.com/jaisanant0/face-recognition-cnn "

* My ideas is training model for 1-10 images/classs that i can appreciate the result thought My original dataset.

* Then I had got a statistics result based on by visual such as the face-recognize was good activation with 4 images/class with by 85% accurately. 

* Conclusively, I recommend with meta learning when you use a pre-training you need only a little proper database, when more it not good for the algotithms.

* The exactly of the method was arange 75-90% if you choose a good model as well as the good database and the good distancely calculation that the author use Euclip distance.

* If you need a algorithms have more accurate, I think meta learninig needed to innovate that is my opinion
